# Integrated Coastal Resilience and Blue Economy Development for Bangladesh

A comprehensive simulation and analysis platform for modeling, visualizing, and advancing coastal resilience and blue economy development in Bangladesh. This project integrates climate, environmental, socioeconomic, blue economy, and policy models to support long-term, climate-resilient planning and sustainable development.

## Project Overview
This platform simulates the complex interactions between climate change, ecosystems, socioeconomic factors, blue economy sectors, and policy interventions over a 15-year horizon. It is designed to help researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders:
- Assess climate and environmental risks
- Evaluate adaptation and development strategies
- Visualize integrated outcomes and trade-offs
- Support evidence-based decision-making for coastal Bangladesh

## Model Descriptions
- **Climate Model:** Projects sea level rise, temperature, rainfall, and storm surge intensity.
- **Environmental Model:** Simulates mangrove coverage, biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem health.
- **Socioeconomic Model:** Models population, GDP, employment, poverty, and infrastructure quality.
- **Blue Economy Model:** Tracks fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, biotechnology, and total blue economy value.
- **Policy Model:** Assesses policy impact, budget utilization, institutional performance, and monitoring effectiveness.

Each model is modular and can be extended or replaced for scenario analysis.

## Simulation Workflow
1. **Run the simulation:**
   - Integrates all models over a 15-year period.
   - Computes resilience, sustainability, and development indices.
   - Aggregates results for analysis and visualization.
2. **Save results:**
   - Outputs raw data (`.npy`, `.json`) and summary tables (`.csv`).
   - Stores all plots and analytics in the `output/` directory.
3. **Visualize:**
   - Use built-in tools for time series, correlation, radar charts, PCA, and sensitivity analysis.

## Visualization Features
- **Basic Visualizations:**
  - Indices and indicator trends (resilience, sustainability, development, climate, environment, socioeconomic, blue economy, policy)
  - Correlation matrices
  - Summary tables
- **Advanced Visualizations:**
  - Radar charts for multi-indicator comparison
  - Trend analysis with moving averages
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Sensitivity analysis for key parameters

All plots are saved in the output directory for each simulation run.

## Pushing Results to GitHub
To push your latest simulation results and visualizations to your GitHub repository:

```bash
python push_to_github.py <output/simulation_TIMESTAMP>
```
- The script will initialize the repo (if needed), add, commit, and push all changes to the `master` branch.
- Make sure you have the correct permissions and have set up your remote repository.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deluair/Integrated-Coastal-Resilience-and-Blue-Economy-Development-for-Bangladesh.git
   cd Integrated-Coastal-Resilience-and-Blue-Economy-Development-for-Bangladesh
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- **Run a full simulation:**
  ```bash
  python run_simulation.py
  ```
- **View and analyze results:**
  - Check the `output/` directory for generated data and plots.
  - Use the example scripts in `examples/` for custom analysis or visualization.
- **Push results to GitHub:**
  ```bash
  python push_to_github.py <output/simulation_TIMESTAMP>
  ```
